*   **FIX**: Completely resolved the critical `PineconeArgumentError` and related issues that were causing chatbot crashes. Multiple interconnected problems were identified and fixed:
    
    **Primary Issue - Invalid Embedding Vectors:**
    - The error "must not have property: vector. Must have required property: id." was occurring when embedding vectors were null, undefined, or malformed
    - **API Layer** (`api/index.js`): Added validation for OpenAI embedding responses with detailed error handling and user-friendly error messages
    - **RAG Service** (`packages/backend/src/rag-service.js`): Added robust validation in `performHybridSearch()` function to verify embedding vectors before Pinecone queries
    
    **Secondary Issue - Missing Embedding Generation:**
    - **Backend Service** (`packages/backend/src/index.js`): Fixed critical bug where the backend service was calling `generateResponse()` without generating embedding vectors first
    - Added complete embedding generation pipeline with OpenAI validation and error handling
    - Fixed parameter misalignment in `generateResponse()` calls where chat context was being passed instead of embedding vectors
    
    **Tertiary Issue - Chat History Type Error:**
    - Fixed `TypeError: chatHistory.split is not a function` by adding type validation for chat history data
    - Added graceful handling when chat history is not a string format
    
    **System-wide Improvements:**
    - **Error Handling**: Wrapped all `performHybridSearch()` calls in try-catch blocks to gracefully handle invalid embeddings
    - **Fallback Behavior**: When embeddings fail, the system now returns empty results instead of crashing, ensuring uninterrupted user experience
    - **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging embedding vector dimensions and validation failures across all services

*   **FEATURE**: Added a new endpoint to support dynamic widget configuration.
*   **FIX**: Resolved a critical issue where the chatbot would crash if the user's message was too long.
*   **CHORE**: Refactored the database schema to improve performance.

*   **FIX**: The Pinecone query object was incorrectly wrapped in an extra `query` object, which was causing a `PineconeArgumentError`. This was resolved by removing the incorrect nesting.
