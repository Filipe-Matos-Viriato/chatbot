*   **FIX**: Completely resolved the critical `PineconeArgumentError` that was causing chatbot crashes. The error "must not have property: vector. Must have required property: id." was occurring when embedding vectors were null, undefined, or malformed. Implemented a comprehensive solution across the entire application stack:
    - **API Layer** (`api/index.js`): Added validation for OpenAI embedding responses with detailed error handling and user-friendly error messages
    - **RAG Service** (`packages/backend/src/rag-service.js`): Added robust validation in `performHybridSearch()` function to verify embedding vectors before Pinecone queries
    - **Error Handling**: Wrapped all `performHybridSearch()` calls in try-catch blocks to gracefully handle invalid embeddings
    - **Fallback Behavior**: When embeddings fail, the system now returns empty results instead of crashing, ensuring uninterrupted user experience
    - **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging embedding vector dimensions and validation failures

*   **FEATURE**: Added a new endpoint to support dynamic widget configuration.
*   **FIX**: Resolved a critical issue where the chatbot would crash if the user's message was too long.
*   **CHORE**: Refactored the database schema to improve performance.

*   **FIX**: The Pinecone query object was incorrectly wrapped in an extra `query` object, which was causing a `PineconeArgumentError`. This was resolved by removing the incorrect nesting.
